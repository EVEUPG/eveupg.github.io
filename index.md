## What is this?

UPG is a new Pochven group with selective recruitment and high requirements that runs NPSI-style fleets, primarily flying a doctrine type commonly known as 'Heavy Armor'. The goal is for this group to consist of self-sufficient individuals who are interested in flying high-end heavy armor battleships and engaging in regular PvP activities centered around Observatory Flashpoints in Pochven.

## Who can join?

Anyone can apply as long as they meet these minimum requirements:

* Two characters on different Omega accounts that are able to fly armor battleships and meet the basic skill requirements.
* Working microphone and ability to both speak and understand English at an intermediate level.
* Familiarity with Pochven as a region OR a strong ability to learn from mistakes and follow directions.
* At least two full sets of Mid-grade Amulet implants, one for each Battleship character.

## Why?

CCP's recent changes to Pochven have created a possibility for non-solo (heavily multiboxed/gigaboxed) heavy armor fleets to be viable again. I consider this style of gameplay to be uniquely enjoyable and fulfilling, and would like to give it a try again.

## Who is in charge?

My name is Kontan Rekor, and I'm one of the founders of the original incarnation of UPG, which ceased to exist when I took a break from the game in late 2022. That group eventually became Totality Squad, which still exists and is run by original members of UPG.

I was the primary heavy armor fleet commander for both UPG and Totality Squad at various points in time, having lead dozens of fleets over the past three years.

## What are the specifics?

* **Handout Ships** - I have a large cache of ships, fitting, rigs, and ammo in Pochven, and members of UPG will be able to be receive a ship based on their need.

* **Fleet Sizes** - I'm aiming for at least 8 people per fleet, with each person being capable of bringing two heavy armor ships. If we have more people, excess characters will be used for scouting or in other support roles such as interdictors/command destroyers. Fleet sizes will stay reasonable, and recruitment levels will adjust as-needed.

* **Partial 'SRP'** - Loot will go to the group, with excess amounts being split among active members of UPG that plan to re-invest those resources into Pochven. Replacement for losses will be sourced from loot or donations from other members based on need.

* **Regular PvP** - I have talked to various groups in Pochven, and would like to ensure that we get reasonable fights by being willing to upship/downship as needed. I don't believe that 'winning at all costs' is necessary or possible in the current Pochven environment, and would rather this group be seen as a guaranteed source of fun content (but not a punching bag!)

* **Staging** - Fleets will be run out of Senda, which is in the Krai Veles constellation of Pochven. Secondary staging locations will be Perimeter and Tuuriainas.

* **Null-sec** - I (Kontan Rekor) am a member of a Null-sec coalition, just as I was when I first started UPG 3 years ago. I do not require or expect members to be a part of any particular null-sec group.

* **'NPSI-Style'** - Fleets will not be full 'NPSI', but will instead engage in pvp based on the political landscape of the region. Members will be restricted to shooting what the FC calls during UPG fleets.

* **Training Opportunities** - UPG would like to facilitate the ability for other groups to start running their own Heavy Armor fleets in Pochven. If you're an FC from another part of the game, make sure to mention that when you apply.

## How long do you plan to run for?

I have engaged in Pochven content for a long time (with long periods of periodic inactivity), and would like to see if these recent changes by CCP will make my favorite playstyle viable again.

If I run out of funds/resources, members, or Pochven enters an incredibly unhealthy state, then that will be it. I don't have the same lofty goals as I did previously in Pochven/EVE, so the stakes are low, but the potential for fun and rewarding gameplay is definitely there.
